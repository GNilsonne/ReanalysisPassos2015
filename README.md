# ReanalysisPassos2015
This repository contains three files:
- data_fig3a.csv. These data have been manually entered into a file and are based on figure 3a from Passos et al. 2015: http/dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(15)00309-0
- PETPEESE. This script contains functions to perform PET and PEESE regression and visualise results. They are adapted with gratitude from https://github.com/Joe-Hilgard/Anderson-meta/blob/master/Anderson_2010_PET-PEESE.R
- Analysis. This script reads the data and performs meta-analysis with bias adjustment.
